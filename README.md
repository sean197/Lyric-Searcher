# Lyric-Searcher

This is a lyric searching app which was created using vanilla JavaScript.

The aim of the project was for a user to be able to search his/her favourite artists songs or an individual song of their preference.

When the user searches a song or artist the album cover song and artist name would be displayed.

The project was used to consolidate my knowledge of fetch API, async/await and promises.
